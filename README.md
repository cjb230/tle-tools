# tle-tools
Partly to mess around with orbital dynamics, partly to mess around with modern python project tools

Little stuck on the pre-commit stuff: right now I have black using the github repo instead of local settings, but if I make the pre-commit config file looks more like this: https://github.com/cjolowicz/hypermodern-python/blob/master/.pre-commit-config.yaml then I have binary incompatability issues.
